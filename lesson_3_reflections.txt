1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Pretty much always. With exclusion of secret projects.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To preserve control on the changes beeing made.
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks is a feature of GitHub - it happends on GitHub
Clones - are working remote to local or local to local
Branches - are operations on a some repo - they create new paths from some current branch
4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can work continously on a branch. We don't have to merge.
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
It would be harder without using Git or GitHub with more that one programmer.
